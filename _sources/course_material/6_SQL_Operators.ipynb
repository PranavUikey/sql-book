    "# Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of operators in SQL that are used to perform different operations on data. Here are some common types of operators in SQL along with one example of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comparison Operators:\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "   ``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Description: Comparison operators such as \">\" (greater than), \"<\" (less than), \"=\" (equal to), \"<>\" (not equal to), etc., are used to compare values in a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logical Operators:\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "   ``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000 AND department = 'Sales';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Description: Logical operators such as \"AND\", \"OR\", and \"NOT\" are used to combine multiple conditions in a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arithmetic Operators:\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "   ``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT salary * 1.1 AS increased_salary FROM employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Description: Arithmetic operators such as \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", and \"/\" are used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric values in a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. String Operators:\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT CONCAT(full_name,' ',last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Description: This function used to manipulate and combine strings in a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Null-Related Operators:\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "   ``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Description: Null-related operators such as \"IS NULL\" and \"IS NOT NULL\" are used to check for null values in a query.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. Inclusion Operators:\n",
    "  - Example: \n",
    "  ``` sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - Description: Inclusion operators are used to check if a value exists in a set or a range. These are the operators: \"IN\", \"BETWEEN\", \"LIKE\".\n",

    "   ``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age <= 40;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "### 7. IS NULL operator:\n",

    "``` sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT department = 'HR';\n",

    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators in SQL are used to perform mathematical operations on the values stored in columns or to combine values together. Let's explain the arithmetic operators using the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we have the `employees` table created and populated with the provided data, here are some examples of arithmetic operations using the table's columns:\n",

    "SELECT salary + 1000 AS increased_salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query adds 1000 to the `salary` column for each employee and returns the result as `increased_salary`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "This query subtracts 5000 from the `salary` column for each employee and returns the result as `decreased_salary`.\n",

    "SELECT salary * 0.1 AS bonus_amount\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query multiplies the `salary` column by 0.1 (10%) for each employee and returns the result as `bonus_amount`.\n",

    "SELECT salary / age AS salary_per_age\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query divides the `salary` column by the `age` column for each employee and returns the result as `salary_per_age`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "This query concatenates the `name` column, a comma, and the `department` column for each employee, resulting in the combined string as `employee_info`.\n",

    "### 2. Length (LENGTH):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query retrieves the `name` column and calculates the length of each name using the `LENGTH` function, returning the result as `name_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Upper case (UPPER):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, UPPER(name) AS uppercase_name\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query retrieves the `name` column and converts each name to uppercase using the `UPPER` function, returning the result as `uppercase_name`.\n",

    "SELECT name, LOWER(name) AS lowercase_name\n",

    "```\n",
    "This query retrieves the `name` column and converts each name to lowercase using the `LOWER` function, returning the result as `lowercase_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Substring (SUBSTRING or SUBSTR):\n",
    "The substring function is used to extract a portion of a string based on a specified starting position and length.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUBSTRING(name, 1, 3) AS initials\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query retrieves the first three characters from the `name` column for each employee, returning the result as `initials`.\n",

    "This query retrieves all rows from the `employees` table where the `department` column does not contain NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. COALESCE:\n",
    "The COALESCE function is used to return the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COALESCE(department, 'Unknown') AS department\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT NULLIF(salary, 0) AS salary\n",
