    "## CASE STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CASE statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASE statement in SQL is a conditional statement that allows you to perform different actions based on specified conditions. It provides a way to control the flow of the query and perform conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is CASE statement used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of the CASE statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CASE\n",
    "    WHEN condition1 THEN result1\n",
    "    WHEN condition2 THEN result2\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    ELSE result\n",
    "END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of the CASE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a table called \"employees\" with columns \"name\" and \"salary\". We want to categorize employees into different salary ranges based on their salary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary,\n",
    "    CASE\n",
    "        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Low Salary'\n",
    "        WHEN salary >= 50000 AND salary < 80000 THEN 'Medium Salary'\n",
    "        ELSE 'High Salary'\n",
    "    END AS salary_category\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we select the \"name\" and \"salary\" columns from the \"employees\" table. The CASE statement is used to check the salary value for each employee and assign a corresponding category based on the specified conditions. If the salary is less than 50000, it is categorized as 'Low Salary'. If the salary is between 50000 and 80000, it is categorized as 'Medium Salary'. For any other salary values, it is categorized as 'High Salary'. The result set will include the employee name, salary, and the assigned salary category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does CASE statement work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the CASE statement works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The CASE statement evaluates the specified conditions one by one.\n",
    "2. If a condition evaluates to true, the corresponding result expression is returned.\n",
    "3. If none of the conditions evaluate to true, the result expression in the ELSE clause is returned.\n",
    "4. The CASE statement can be used in different parts of a query, such as in the SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate how the CASE statement works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a table called \"employees\" with columns \"name\", \"department\" and \"salary\". We want to compute bonus amount based on various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT name, department, salary,\n",
    "    CASE department\n",
    "        WHEN 'HR' THEN salary * 0.1\n",
    "        WHEN 'Sales' THEN salary * 0.15\n",
    "        WHEN 'IT' THEN salary * 0.12\n",
    "        ELSE 0\n",
    "    END AS bonus\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the CASE statement computes the bonus amount based on the department of each employee. It multiplies the salary by a specific percentage for each department and assigns the result as the bonus. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CASE statement provides a flexible way to perform conditional operations and derive computed values based on specific conditions in SQL queries."
