    "## What is WHERE clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "After familiarizing yourself with using the **SELECT** and **FROM** clauses to retrieve data, the subsequent progression involves applying data filters through the utilization of the **WHERE** clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL **WHERE** clauses are used to filter rows in a query based on specified conditions. They allow you to retrieve only the rows that meet specific criteria from a table. The **WHERE** clause is commonly used with the **SELECT** statement, but it can also be used with other statements like **UPDATE** and **DELETE** to apply conditions to those operations.(we will discuss this in next chapter)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How WHERE clause is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax of the WHERE clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **WHERE** clause is placed after the **FROM** clause and before any other clauses (e.g., GROUP BY, ORDER BY). The condition specified in the WHERE clause determines which rows are included in the result set. The condition can be a combination of comparison operators, logical operators, and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of using the **WHERE** clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Selecting rows with a specific value:\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE column1 = 'value';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Selecting rows based on multiple conditions:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE column1 = 'value' AND column2 > 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Using comparison operators:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE column1 > 100 OR column2 IS NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Using wildcard characters:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE column1 LIKE 'abc%';\n",
    "```\n",

    "In SQL, **LIKE and NOT LIKE** are operators used to perform pattern matching within WHERE clause conditions. They are typically used with strings, allowing you to filter query results based on specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `LIKE` \n",
    "\n",
    "This operator is used when you want to search for a specified pattern in a column. SQL LIKE clause is used with the WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. Wildcards are used with the LIKE operator to make a pattern. These wildcards are % (percent sign) and _ (underscore).\n",
    "\n",
    "% represents zero, one, or multiple characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "_ represents a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'A%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement would return all rows from the table_name where the column_name begins with the letter \"A\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### `NOT LIKE`\n",
    "\n",
    "This operator is used to exclude rows that match a specified pattern. It's the opposite of the LIKE operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT LIKE 'A%';\n",

    "\n",

    "The **ORDER BY** clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query based on one or more columns. It allows you to specify the sorting order, such as ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC), for the values in the specified column(s). The **ORDER BY** clause is typically used with the **SELECT** statement to arrange the query results in a desired order.\n",

    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the syntax above, you specify the columns you want to sort by within the **ORDER BY** clause. Each column can be followed by either ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending) to determine the sorting order. By default, if no sorting order is specified, ASC is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of using the ORDER BY clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorting in ascending order:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "ORDER BY column1 ASC;\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the **ORDER BY** clause works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The SELECT statement retrieves data from a table or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **ORDER BY** clause is included at the end of the SELECT statement, after the WHERE clause (if present).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Within the **ORDER BY** clause, you specify the column(s) or expressions that determine the sorting order of the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. By default, the sorting order is ascending (ASC), meaning the values will be arranged in ascending order from lowest to highest. You can also explicitly specify descending (DESC) order to arrange values from highest to lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If multiple columns or expressions are specified in the **ORDER BY** clause, the sorting is performed sequentially based on the specified order. The first column/expression mentioned will be the primary sort key, followed by subsequent columns/expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The result set is then sorted according to the specified order, and the sorted rows are returned as the output of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;\n",

    "\n",
    "The **ORDER BY** clause is particularly useful when you want to present the query results in a specific order, such as sorting names alphabetically, ordering numeric values, or arranging dates chronologically. It allows you to control the sequence of the output based on your requirements."

    "## LIMIT and OFFSET:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **LIMIT** and **OFFSET** clauses in SQL are used to control the number of records returned by a query, and to specify from which point to start returning records. This is especially useful for implementing pagination in applications where you need to display a subset of records at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIMIT Clause  :\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT restricts the number of rows returned by a query. It's widely used in situations where you only need a specific number of rows from a result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT columns FROM table\n",
    "LIMIT [number_of_rows];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "for example , consider this query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query returns the first 5 records from the student table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### OFFSET Clause  :\n",
    "\n",
    "OFFSET skips a specified number of rows before beginning to return rows from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT columns FROM table\n",
    "LIMIT [number_of_rows] OFFSET [row_num];\n",

    "for example , consider this query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query skips the first 10 records and then returns the next 5 records from the student table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations  :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The OFFSET value is zero-based. This means OFFSET 0 starts from the very first record.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using LIMIT and OFFSET can impact performance, especially with a large OFFSET value, as the database still has to read through all the preceding rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Always ensure your results are ordered (using ORDER BY) when using LIMIT and OFFSET for consistent output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example where you have a table named Students and you want to apply LIMIT and OFFSET clauses along with an ORDER BY statement. The Students table could include columns such as StudentID, Name, and Grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you want to display student records in descending order of their grades, and you want to implement pagination showing 10 students per page, here's how the SQL query would look:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Display the first 10 students with the highest grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT StudentID, Name, Grade \n",
    "FROM Students \n",
    "ORDER BY Grade DESC \n",
    "LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation  :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ORDER BY Grade DESC: This part of the query ensures that the students are listed in descending order of their grades, meaning students with higher grades are listed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LIMIT 10: This restricts the output to 10 rows, which is useful for displaying a specific number of students per page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OFFSET: This specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the query. For the first page, OFFSET is 0 as you want to start from the first row. For the second page, it's 10 (skipping the first 10 rows), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is a classic example of how LIMIT and OFFSET can be used for effective pagination in applications where you need to present data in a structured and manageable way."
