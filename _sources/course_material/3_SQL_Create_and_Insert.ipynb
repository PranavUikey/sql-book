    "## DATA TYPES\n",
    "In SQL, data types define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a table. Each column in a table is assigned a specific data type, which determines the kind of values that can be stored in that column. Here are some commonly used data types in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Integer (INT):\n",
    "   - Used to store whole numbers without decimal places.\n",
    "   - Example: 42, -10, 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Decimal/numeric (DECIMAL/NUMERIC):\n",
    "   - Used to store decimal numbers with a specified precision and scale.\n",
    "   - Example: 3.14, -0.5, 123.456.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Varchar/char/nvarchar (VARCHAR/CHAR/NVARCHAR):\n",
    "   - Used to store character strings of variable or fixed lengths.\n",
    "   - Example: 'Hello', 'OpenAI', '12345'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Date (DATE):\n",
    "   - Used to store dates without time information.\n",
    "   - Example: '2023-05-21'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Time (TIME):\n",
    "   - Used to store time values without date information.\n",
    "   - Example: '13:45:00'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. DateTime/TimeStamp (DATETIME/TIMESTAMP):\n",
    "   - Used to store date and time values.\n",
    "   - Example: '2023-05-21 13:45:00'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Boolean (BOOL):\n",
    "   - Used to store true or false values.\n",
    "   - Example: true, false.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can dive deeper into **SQL DATA TYPES** by using this link.\n",

    "## What to do after table creation?\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a table in SQL, there are several actions you can take depending on your specific requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insert Data**: Use the **INSERT** statement to add rows of data into the table. You specify the column names and provide the corresponding values for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieve Data**: Use the **SELECT** statement to query and retrieve data from the table. You can specify the columns you want to retrieve and apply conditions using the **WHERE** clause for filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Data**: Use the **UPDATE** statement to modify existing data in the table. You can specify the column(s) to be updated and provide new values. Conditions can be applied using the **WHERE** clause to update specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Delete Data**: Use the **DELETE** statement to remove rows from the table. You can specify conditions using the **WHERE** clause to delete specific rows or delete all rows without conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Modify Table Structure**: If needed, you can alter the table structure using the **ALTER TABLE** statement. This allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, change data types, and perform other modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Create Indexes**: Indexes can be created on specific columns to improve query performance. Indexes help in faster data retrieval by creating a sorted structure of the indexed column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some common actions you can perform after creating a table in SQL. The specific operations you choose will depend on your data management and analysis requirements."

    "## Insert Data into the Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting data into a table is a fundamental operation in SQL that allows you to populate a table with new rows of data. This process is crucial for building a database's content and making it useful for applications. The `INSERT INTO` statement is used for this purpose, and it enables you to add data to specific columns of a table. Let's delve into the process of inserting data into a table in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert data into a table, you need to specify the table name and the values you want to insert. The basic syntax of the `INSERT INTO` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)\n",
    "VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `INSERT INTO`: The command used to indicate that you want to insert data into a table.\n",
    "- `table_name`: The name of the table where you want to insert data.\n",
    "- `(column1, column2, column3, ...)`: A comma-separated list of column names indicating which columns you want to insert data into.\n",
    "- `VALUES`: The keyword used to indicate that you are providing values for the specified columns.\n",
    "- `(value1, value2, value3, ...)`: A comma-separated list of values that correspond to the columns you specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider a table named \"cities\" with columns: city_id, name, pincode, state. You can insert a new city record like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO cities (city_id, name, pincode, state)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Mumbai', 400001, 'Maharashtra'),\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the data for the \"employee_id,\" \"first_name,\" \"last_name,\" and \"salary\" columns is provided in the `VALUES` clause. The specified values correspond to the specified columns in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also insert multiple rows of data in a single `INSERT INTO` statement by separating the sets of values with commas. Here's an example inserting two cities records:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO cities (city_id, name, pincode, state)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Mumbai', 400001, 'Maharashtra'),\n",
    "       (2, 'Chennai', 400002, 'Tamilnadu');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to ensure that the data you insert adheres to the data types and constraints defined for the table columns. For example, if a column has a numeric data type, you should provide numeric values; if a column is defined as a date, use a valid date format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may want to insert data into only specific columns while leaving others empty. To achieve this, you can omit the column names for which you're not providing data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO cities (city_id, name, pincode)\n",
    "VALUES (3, 'Pune', 411006);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that inserting data into a table impacts the database's integrity and structure, so it's essential to double-check the data you're inserting to ensure accuracy and consistency. Additionally, you can combine the `INSERT INTO` statement with other SQL statements to perform more complex operations, such as inserting data based on the result of a subquery or combining data from multiple tables before insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, inserting data into a table in SQL using the `INSERT INTO` statement is a fundamental database operation. It allows you to populate tables with relevant data and is a critical step in building functional and meaningful databases for various applications.\n"
